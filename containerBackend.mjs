/**
 * `WorkerPoolBackend` over a container engine on this machine: a container
 * per assignment, run from the image the assignment pins, whose entrypoint is
 * the worker core. chuggy's Kubernetes pool backend is the behaviour this
 * mirrors, with a container where it has a pod.
 *
 * PLACEMENT IS ASYNCHRONOUS. The plane renews a lease only while a poll names
 * it held, and a cold pull can outlast a lease, so `place` decides only
 * whether this machine can take the work; the pull and the run happen behind
 * it, and `held` answers for them meanwhile. One that fails leaves `held` and
 * is logged.
 *
 * WHAT IS RUNNING IS READ FROM THE ENGINE. `held` lists this pool's containers
 * by label and reads each one's assignment and deadline off its labels, so a
 * restarted runner picks up what its predecessor started. A container that
 * has ended, or has run past its deadline, has its logs saved and is removed
 * rather than answered. A listing that failed throws, because the emptier
 * answer is the one that loses work.
 *
 * WHAT ENDED OF ITSELF IS NAMED ONCE. `ended` names the job of each container
 * `held` found ended or killed at its deadline, and of each placement that
 * failed, with this backend's own reason, never the job's log, which can hold
 * a secret. A failed placement's job is the one it held; a container's is read
 * back from the envelope it was run with. One this pool stopped is never named.
