# THE LOAD-BEARING CASE is that a gate which could not run is a loud skip here
# and a failure in `just check`. That asymmetry is why the hook can be trusted
# not to block a commit the full check would accept, and it is the behaviour a
# well-meaning edit is most likely to "fix" into a rejection.
#
# Its boundary is the case after it: a gate the hook names and cannot find
# stops the commit, because that is a claim about the tree rather than about
# the machine the hook happens to be running on.
