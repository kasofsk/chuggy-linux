# EVERY RULE IN `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` GETS A TREE THAT VIOLATES IT. A rule
# that has never rejected anything is an unverified control, and the real tree
# passes, which is what a fixture carrying the violation is for. Each fixture
# copies the real config — a suite testing a config of its own invention would
# pass while this tree's rules were broken.
#
# A CASE NAMES ITS RULE WITH THE COLON THE REPORTER PRINTS AFTER IT. The bare
# name is a substring, and a rule renamed around it would satisfy the match and
# read as the rule working.
