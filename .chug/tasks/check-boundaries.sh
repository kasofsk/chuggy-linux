# The runner reaches only Node, its neighbours, and the packages its tarball
# bundles, by name — never a devDependency, which resolves in every suite here
# and in no install. The rules are in `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`.
#
# THE CRUISE STARTS AT EVERY TRACKED `.mjs`, suites and fixtures included:
# a suite that named a devDependency would prove something about a module
# graph no install has.
#
# THE WRAPPER IS WHAT SPLITS THE EXIT CODES. dependency-cruiser exits non-zero
# both on a violation and when it cannot resolve a module; the tool run
# unwrapped would report those as one answer.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. A capability reached without an import — a global, a
# dynamic `import()` built from a computed string, a value injected at run time
# — is invisible to a static graph.
#
# Usage:
#   .chug/tasks/check-boundaries.sh
#
# Exits 0 clean, 1 on a finding, 2 when it could not run. Two is not a pass.
