# Shared harness for the `*.test.sh` suites. Sourced, never executed:
#
#   . "$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)/_suite.sh"
#
# It holds the harness and nothing that makes a case what it is: the fixtures,
# the drivers and the assertions stay in each suite. It carries no `set -eu` —
# the sourcing suite sets its own options.
#
# Contract for a sourcing suite:
#   provides   $WORK        a temp dir, removed on exit
#              $OUT         where a driver should write captured output
#              check        assert an exit code and a substring of $OUT
#              refute       assert an exit code and the absence of one
#              fresh_repo   a throwaway git checkout
#              done_        print the tally and exit non-zero if anything failed
#   expects    the suite to set $OUT before each check
