# A path this tree names must be a path this tree has.
#
# WHOLE TREE, EVERY FILE TYPE. Prose about paths lives in module comments,
# shell headers and markdown alike.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A CLAIM. A token with a slash in it, and then only under one
# of two positive rules. Everything else is skipped in SILENCE:
#
#   R1  Its first segment is a tracked top-level entry of this repo, so the
#       token is claiming a path here and the path must resolve — as a tracked
#       file, or as a directory with any tracked file beneath it.
#   R1b A token written with a leading `./` is relative to something, and which
#       is not decidable from the text: a module names its neighbour, a script
#       that has cd'd to the root names the root. So it resolves against the
#       directory of the file that writes it OR against the root, and is a
#       finding only when it resolves against neither. `./name` with no further
#       slash counts too: it is how a module names the file beside it.
#   R2  Its first segment is NOT tracked now, but the token or that segment was
#       tracked at some point in this history. The tree deleted it and the
#       sentence did not notice. Asking git what it ever had separates some
#       other repo's path from our own deleted one, and needs no list of
#       tombstones for anyone to maintain.
#
# IN A `*.test.sh`, ONLY COMMENT LINES ARE READ. A suite builds fixture trees in
# a throwaway repo, so its code is full of paths that are real somewhere else;
# what a suite says about THIS repo it says in its header.
#
# SKIPPED, deliberately: a glob or a placeholder, a token a glob character
# immediately follows, a shell variable, a bracketed template, an absolute or
# home-relative path, a URL, an elision, and any token whose first segment
# neither is nor ever was ours. That last includes every path of chuggy's a
# comment here names, so whether such a path is named as chuggy's is the
# reviewer's to hold, not this gate's.
#
# THERE IS ONE EXEMPTION, IT COVERS MARKDOWN, AND IT SUPPRESSES NOTHING: a
# `*.md` line carrying one of CLAUDE.md's claim markers — `<!-- intent -->`,
# `<!-- runtime -->`, `<!-- absent -->`. The path is still resolved and still
# reported; it prints as `intent` rather than `ERROR` and is counted separately
# in the tally, so a doc naming a path nobody built says so on every run. The
# marker is an HTML comment, which only markdown carries; a code comment names
# what its own tree has.
#
# What is still forbidden everywhere, markdown included, is an UNMARKED claim —
# and naming a *specific* deleted file exactly, since neither skip above
# applies to one.
#
# Usage:
#   .chug/tasks/check-paths.sh [<file>...]
#
# Exits 0 clean, 1 on a finding, 2 when it could not run. Two is not a pass.
