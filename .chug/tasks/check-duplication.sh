# Copy-paste detection at threshold 0: no clone of the size `.jscpd.json` sets,
# anywhere, ever. Tests are in scope. Where a genuine scenario must repeat, mark
# the region with `jscpd:ignore-start` and a reason on that line.
#
# A SCAN THAT MEASURED NOTHING IS A COULD-NOT-RUN. Two shapes: no verdict in the
# output, and a verdict over an empty scan. A fetch failure produces the first
# and a mis-scoped `ignorePattern` the second, and "no clones" over nothing
# reads exactly like "no clones" over the tree.
#
# `.jscpd.json` is JSON and carries no comments, so its ignore list is stated
# here. `**/.claude/worktrees/**` is there because a git worktree is a second
# copy of the tree: scanned, every file pairs against its own copy. Markdown is
# prose, and JSON is data the formatter and the suites judge.
#
# The version is pinned exactly in package.json: config semantics move within
# the major, `ignorePattern` matching among them.
#
# Exits 0 clean, 1 on a finding, 2 when it could not run. Two is not a pass.
