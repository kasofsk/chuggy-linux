// The runner's boundary: what a module at this repository's root may import.
//
// Every module here runs from the tarball `npm pack` builds, beside the
// packages it bundles and nothing else, and a suite is held to the same so that
// what it proves is what ships. So a module here reaches Node's own modules,
// its neighbours at the root, and the bundled packages, by name.
//
// Every rule below is proved to bite against a fixture tree carrying its
// violation, in `.chug/tasks/check-boundaries.test.sh`. A boundary rule that
// has never rejected anything is an unverified control.
